      A croissant (French pronunciation: [kʁwasɑ̃] ) is a buttery, flaky,
      viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but
      using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for
      their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled
      and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in
      a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky
      texture, similar to a puff pastry. Crescent-shaped breads have been made
      since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.
      Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian cuisine, and are often found
      in French bakeries and pâtisseries. The modern croissant was developed in
      the early 20th century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of
      the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated dough. In the late 1970s, the
      development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them
      into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The
      croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French
      response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30–40% of the
      croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen
      dough. Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many
      European countries and served as dessert all around the world.
